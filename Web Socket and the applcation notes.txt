                                          -- Real time chat application --


Here we are going to learn about the web socket concept by creating one chat application in spring boot where multiple user can chat with each other 
in a single page 

Normally in HTTP protocol a client will request something to the server and then server will send the response to the client as per the request
and also server will not recognise or save the request any where its like client will send and server will receive and send the response 

But in chat application scenario is not that here client and serevr are connected with each other if te client want to left then only client will 
disconnected from the server . So for that we are using web socket . This is a bidirectional protocol . This is a full duplex protocol . 

Here we will do something like if the client will send the request to the server we will accept the request and we will connect together
(client <-> server)
by the help of web socket , this will establish the connection in betweedn serverand the client .
This connection will be connected with each other for that time when no can can terminate with other

This is the official doc for web socket -->

https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket

I added all the doc for the class and the method in the application  we can refer from there 

In the application -->

To connect with server we have URL : "/server1"
To send the message we have URL : "/app/message" and here we will send the message {JSON}
To sybscribe so that we can receive messages we have URL : "/topic/return-to"
